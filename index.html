    <h3>statement on Palestinian liberation and the ongoing genocide</h3>
        <div> Since 1948, Palestine has been occupied by a settler colonial state and Palestinians have been subject to violent and ongoing ethnic cleansing. isreal, with funding and support from the United States, has created an apartheid state built on the subjugation of Palestinians. 

            A July 5th study published in medical journal The Lancet estimates that 186,000 people, or 8% of Gaza's population, have been killed since October 2024. This violence is only the most recent manifestion of Israel's genocidal aims. Untold Palestinians have been killed, displaced, and imprisoned in service of the zionist project. 
            
            Palestinian resistance to the apartheid and genocide of the zionist project precedes and will outlast israel. The folks who started Take Back Bikes stand in full solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle for liberation. We believe it is imperative to struggle against institutions and corporations that support israel's apartheid state and enable genocide in Gaza.
