        <h2> How to use a TBB Bicycle </h2>
    </div>

    <h3>1. Unlock the bicycle</h3>
    <div class="words"> Look up the combination on the attached fliers, or on this <a href="../meet-the-bikes/index.html"> website</a>!</div>
    
    <br>

    <h3>2. Inspect the bicycle</h3>
    <div class="words">The ABCs of Bicycle Inspection
        <ul>
            <li> AIR - Pinch the tires. They should be hard. </li>

            <li> BRAKES - Make sure that squeezing the levers stops the bike. Pads are not worn down or rubbing the tire. </li>

            <li> CRANK/CHAIN - The chain should be tight and run smoothly. Pedals should spin easily. </li>

            <li> QUICK CHECK - Quick release levers and other bolts should be closed tightly </li>
            <li> GEAR - Wear a helmet! Should be level and snug. </li>
            <li> By riding a TBB bicycle, you agree to the following: <i>"I am capable of riding a bicycle, am capable of assessing whether or not a bicycle is in a suitable condition to be ridden, and will not ride a TBB bicycle if it is not in an appropriate condition to safely ride. TBB makes no representation about the fitness of any bicycle or the date or status of its most recent repair or inspection."</i> </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Ride</h3>
    <div class="words">Please ride safely. Be considerate of pedestrians and other road users. The League of Michigan bicyclists has compiled a list of <a href="https://lmb.org/bike-mi/michigan-compiled-laws-mcl-bicycles-and-the-law/">Michigan cycling laws</a> for your reference.
