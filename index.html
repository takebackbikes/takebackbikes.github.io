    <h3>Statement on Palestinian liberation and the ongoing genocide</h3>
        <div> Since 1948, Palestine has been occupied by a settler colonial state and Palestinians have been subject to violent and ongoing ethnic cleansing. isreal, with funding and support from the United States, has created an apartheid state built on the subjugation of Palestinians.

            A July 5th study published in medical journal The Lancet estimates that 186,000 people, or 8% of Gaza's population, have been killed since October 2024. This violence is only the most recent manifestion of Israel's genocidal aims. Untold Palestinians have been killed, displaced, and imprisoned in service of the zionist project. 
            
            Palestinian resistance to the apartheid and genocide of the zionist project precedes and will outlast israel. The folks who started Take Back Bikes stand in full solidarity with the Palestinian people in their struggle for liberation. We believe it is imperative to struggle against institutions and corporations that support israel's apartheid state and enable genocide in Gaza.

    <h3> Gaza Solidarity Encampment at UofMichigan </h3>
        <div> The Gaza Solidarity Encampment was started by University of Michigan students following months of demands for the university to divest from israel and decades of campus and community based advocacy for Palestian liberation. The university currently has $6 billion in direct and indirect investments in companies that profit off of the genocide of Palestinians. These companies include drone and robotics companies that use facial recognition software to surveil Palestinians, military tech companies that specialize in technology such as F35 planes used to bomb Gazan civilians, and spyware companies that facilitate israel's techno-apartheid.Â 

            Following 7 months of direct action, mass education, and rejected attempts to meet with university administration, students created the encampment as yet another tactic to compel the university to divest from israel. The encampment was a space of radical education, rejection of the norms of a money-driven university, and above all a space of community building. The encampment lasted for 30 days from April 22 until May 21 when UMPD violently tore it down at 5:45am. In the months following, the SE Michigan community has continued organizing in solidarity with Palestine through numerous initiatives and tactics.
